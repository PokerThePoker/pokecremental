so hi

there's a few questions you might be asking, and right now i'm here to answer them!! yippee!!

1. how do i install this?
  go to releases, go to the latest tag or release or whatever, then download the source code of that release. then you'll see a .py file, open it! this will i think trigger your terminal and then you'll be good to go

2. when will updates come?
  idk
